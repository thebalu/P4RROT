Got it up and running (Virtualbox+Docker), tested a few, e.g. barchoba. Trying to understand the code. Started to write a stateful stack based on the SharedArray.

* Is this a good starting exercise?
* What is the env? Is it the same as the test_env?
* Where should my temp index variable be declared? Is it correct to use a register<1> for storing the index long-term? Should that exist in the env, or can it be "internal"
* How to test what code it generates? What's a good dev workflow?
